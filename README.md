Sample Assignment - (Basic Workflow)
=================

This Sample Assignment will go through the workflow of Processing and GitHub that you will use to publish your assignments to GitHub Pages (putting them on the web). Note that this will work out great for simple projects, but we will likely have some projects later in the semester for which this process fails. 

1. Sign up for a free GitHub account if you donâ€™t already have one and sign in to your GitHub account

2. Fork [this repository](https://GitHub.com/APCSLowell/SampleAssignmentSimple). Forking is making a copy of the *repo* (that's short for repository). It's kinda like copying a google doc. Click on the *Fork* button at the top right corner.
